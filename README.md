**Smart electricity meter**



The project aims to improve electricity consumption on a household scale. By using a smart meter system powered by Arduino MEGA, we plan to provide a platform and tools for electricity monitorization, optimization and predictions. By providing real-time insights into energy usage patterns and monthly electricity consumption predictions, the project aims to: 

1. Reduce electricity consumption by showing power consumption and electrical efficiencies of household different appliances 

2. Encourage energy-efficient usage by using LED feedback system indicating varied power usage levels, fault detection system 

3. Reduce carbon emission and damage to the environment by controlling electricity consumption on a household level 

4. Address and try to tackle the problem of Hong Kong's lack of real-time billing transparency, families often receive electricity bill at the end of the month without being able to check and monitor their power consumption, the design aims to provide a better insight on power usage.
