> **Smart electricity meter**



The project aims to improve electricity consumption on a household scale. By using a smart meter system powered by Arduino MEGA, we plan to provide a platform and tools for electricity monitorization, optimization and predictions. By providing real-time insights into energy usage patterns and monthly electricity consumption predictions, the project aims to: 

1. Reduce electricity consumption by showing power consumption and electrical efficiencies of household different appliances 

2. Encourage energy-efficient usage by using LED feedback system indicating varied power usage levels, fault detection system
